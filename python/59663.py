# # Deep Convolutional GANs
# 
# In this notebook, you'll build a GAN using convolutional layers in the generator and discriminator. This is called a Deep Convolutional GAN, or DCGAN for short. The DCGAN architecture was first explored last year and has seen impressive results in generating new images, you can read the [original paper here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf).
# 
# You'll be training DCGAN on the [Street View House Numbers](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/) (SVHN) dataset. These are color images of house numbers collected from Google street view. SVHN images are in color and much more variable than MNIST. 
# 
# ![SVHN Examples](assets/SVHN_examples.png)
# 
# So, we'll need a deeper and more powerful network. This is accomplished through using convolutional layers in the discriminator and generator. It's also necessary to use batch normalization to get the convolutional networks to train. The only real changes compared to what [you saw previously](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/gan_mnist) are in the generator and discriminator, otherwise the rest of the implementation is the same.

# ## Generator
# 
# Here you'll build the generator network. The input will be our noise vector `z` as before. Also as before, the output will be a $tanh$ output, but this time with size 32x32 which is the size of our SVHN images.
# 
# What's new here is we'll use convolutional layers to create our new images. The first layer is a fully connected layer which is reshaped into a deep and narrow layer, something like 4x4x1024 as in the original DCGAN paper. Then we use batch normalization and a leaky ReLU activation. Next is a transposed convolution where typically you'd halve the depth and double the width and height of the previous layer. Again, we use batch normalization and leaky ReLU. For each of these layers, the general scheme is convolution > batch norm > leaky ReLU.
# 
# You keep stacking layers up like this until you get the final transposed convolution layer with shape 32x32x3. Below is the archicture used in the original DCGAN paper:
# 
# ![DCGAN Generator](assets/dcgan.png)
# 
# Note that the final layer here is 64x64x3, while for our SVHN dataset, we only want it to be 32x32x3.

def generator(z, output_dim, reuse=False, alpha=0.2, training=True):
    with tf.variable_scope('generator', reuse=reuse):
        # First fully connected layer
        x1 = tf.layers.dense(z, 4*4*512)
        # Reshape it to start the convolutional stack
        x1 = tf.reshape(x1, (-1, 4, 4, 512))
        x1 = tf.layers.batch_normalization(x1, training=training)
        x1 = tf.maximum(alpha * x1, x1)
        # 4x4x512 now
        
        x2 = tf.layers.conv2d_transpose(x1, 256, 5, strides=2, padding='same')
        x2 = tf.layers.batch_normalization(x2, training=training)
        x2 = tf.maximum(alpha * x2, x2)
        # 8x8x256 now
        
        x3 = tf.layers.conv2d_transpose(x2, 128, 5, strides=2, padding='same')
        x3 = tf.layers.batch_normalization(x3, training=training)
        x3 = tf.maximum(alpha * x3, x3)
        # 16x16x128 now
        
        # Output layer
        logits = tf.layers.conv2d_transpose(x3, output_dim, 5, strides=2, padding='same')
        # 32x32x3 now
        
        out = tf.tanh(logits)
        
        return out


# ## Discriminator
# 
# Here you'll build the discriminator. This is basically just a convolutional classifier like you've build before. The input to the discriminator are 32x32x3 tensors/images. You'll want a few convolutional layers, then a fully connected layer for the output. As before, we want a sigmoid output, and you'll need to return the logits as well. For the depths of the convolutional layers I suggest starting with 16, 32, 64 filters in the first layer, then double the depth as you add layers. Note that in the DCGAN paper, they did all the downsampling using only strided convolutional layers with no maxpool layers.
# 
# You'll also want to use batch normalization with `tf.layers.batch_normalization` on each layer except the first convolutional and output layers. Again, each layer should look something like convolution > batch norm > leaky ReLU. 
# 
# Note: in this project, your batch normalization layers will always use batch statistics. (That is, always set `training` to `True`.) That's because we are only interested in using the discriminator to help train the generator. However, if you wanted to use the discriminator for inference later, then you would need to set the `training` parameter appropriately.

# - `decoding_layer_infer`
# - `decoding_layer`

# ### Input
# Implement the `model_inputs()` function to create TF Placeholders for the Neural Network. It should create the following placeholders:
# 
# - Input text placeholder named "input" using the TF Placeholder name parameter with rank 2.
# - Targets placeholder with rank 2.
# - Learning rate placeholder with rank 0.
# - Keep probability placeholder named "keep_prob" using the TF Placeholder name parameter with rank 0.
# - Target sequence length placeholder named "target_sequence_length" with rank 1
# - Max target sequence length tensor named "max_target_len" getting its value from applying tf.reduce_max on the target_sequence_length placeholder. Rank 0.
# - Source sequence length placeholder named "source_sequence_length" with rank 1
# 
# Return the placeholders in the following the tuple (input, targets, learning rate, keep probability, target sequence length, max target sequence length, source sequence length)

# ## Imperfect Translation
# You might notice that some sentences translate better than others.  Since the dataset you're using only has a vocabulary of 227 English words of the thousands that you use, you're only going to see good results using these words.  For this project, you don't need a perfect translation. However, if you want to create a better translation model, you'll need better data.
# 
# You can train on the [WMT10 French-English corpus](http://www.statmt.org/wmt10/training-giga-fren.tar).  This dataset has more vocabulary and richer in topics discussed.  However, this will take you days to train, so make sure you've a GPU and the neural network is performing well on dataset we provided.  Just make sure you play with the WMT10 corpus after you've submitted this project.
# ## Submitting This Project
# When submitting this project, make sure to run all the cells before saving the notebook. Save the notebook file as "dlnd_language_translation.ipynb" and save it as a HTML file under "File" -> "Download as". Include the "helper.py" and "problem_unittests.py" files in your submission.
# 

# # Your first neural network
# 
# In this project, you'll build your first neural network and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership. We've provided some of the code, but left the implementation of the neural network up to you (for the most part). After you've submitted this project, feel free to explore the data and the model more.

# ## Load and prepare the data
# 
# A critical step in working with neural networks is preparing the data correctly. Variables on different scales make it difficult for the network to efficiently learn the correct weights. Below, we've written the code to load and prepare the data. You'll learn more about this soon!
# 

data_path = 'Bike-Sharing-Dataset/hour.csv'

rides = pd.read_csv(data_path)


rides.head()


# ## Checking out the data
# 
# This dataset has the number of riders for each hour of each day from January 1 2011 to December 31 2012. The number of riders is split between casual and registered, summed up in the `cnt` column. You can see the first few rows of the data above.
# 
# Below is a plot showing the number of bike riders over the first 10 days or so in the data set. (Some days don't have exactly 24 entries in the data set, so it's not exactly 10 days.) You can see the hourly rentals here. This data is pretty complicated! The weekends have lower over all ridership and there are spikes when people are biking to and from work during the week. Looking at the data above, we also have information about temperature, humidity, and windspeed, all of these likely affecting the number of riders. You'll be trying to capture all this with your model.
# 

rides[:24*10].plot(x='dteday', y='cnt')


# ### Dummy variables
# Here we have some categorical variables like season, weather, month. To include these in our model, we'll need to make binary dummy variables. This is simple to do with Pandas thanks to `get_dummies()`.
# 

dummy_fields = ['season', 'weathersit', 'mnth', 'hr', 'weekday']
for each in dummy_fields:
    dummies = pd.get_dummies(rides[each], prefix=each, drop_first=False)
    rides = pd.concat([rides, dummies], axis=1)

fields_to_drop = ['instant', 'dteday', 'season', 'weathersit', 
                  'weekday', 'atemp', 'mnth', 'workingday', 'hr']
data = rides.drop(fields_to_drop, axis=1)
data.head()


# ### Scaling target variables
# To make training the network easier, we'll standardize each of the continuous variables. That is, we'll shift and scale the variables such that they have zero mean and a standard deviation of 1.
# 
# The scaling factors are saved so we can go backwards when we use the network for predictions.
# 

quant_features = ['casual', 'registered', 'cnt', 'temp', 'hum', 'windspeed']
# Store scalings in a dictionary so we can convert back later
scaled_features = {}
for each in quant_features:
    mean, std = data[each].mean(), data[each].std()
    scaled_features[each] = [mean, std]
    data.loc[:, each] = (data[each] - mean)/std


# ### Splitting the data into training, testing, and validation sets
# 
# We'll save the data for the last approximately 21 days to use as a test set after we've trained the network. We'll use this set to make predictions and compare them with the actual number of riders.
# 

# Save data for approximately the last 21 days 
test_data = data[-21*24:]

# Now remove the test data from the data set 
data = data[:-21*24]

# Separate the data into features and targets
target_fields = ['cnt', 'casual', 'registered']
features, targets = data.drop(target_fields, axis=1), data[target_fields]
test_features, test_targets = test_data.drop(target_fields, axis=1), test_data[target_fields]


# We'll split the data into two sets, one for training and one for validating as the network is being trained. Since this is time series data, we'll train on historical data, then try to predict on future data (the validation set).
# 

# Hold out the last 60 days or so of the remaining data as a validation set
train_features, train_targets = features[:-60*24], targets[:-60*24]
val_features, val_targets = features[-60*24:], targets[-60*24:]


# ## Time to build the network
# 
# Below you'll build your network. We've built out the structure and the backwards pass. You'll implement the forward pass through the network. You'll also set the hyperparameters: the learning rate, the number of hidden units, and the number of training passes.
# 
# <img src="assets/neural_network.png" width=300px>
# 
# The network has two layers, a hidden layer and an output layer. The hidden layer will use the sigmoid function for activations. The output layer has only one node and is used for the regression, the output of the node is the same as the input of the node. That is, the activation function is $f(x)=x$. A function that takes the input signal and generates an output signal, but takes into account the threshold, is called an activation function. We work through each layer of our network calculating the outputs for each neuron. All of the outputs from one layer become inputs to the neurons on the next layer. This process is called *forward propagation*.
# 
# We use the weights to propagate signals forward from the input to the output layers in a neural network. We use the weights to also propagate error backwards from the output back into the network to update our weights. This is called *backpropagation*.
# 
# > **Hint:** You'll need the derivative of the output activation function ($f(x) = x$) for the backpropagation implementation. If you aren't familiar with calculus, this function is equivalent to the equation $y = x$. What is the slope of that equation? That is the derivative of $f(x)$.
# 
# Below, you have these tasks:
# 1. Implement the sigmoid function to use as the activation function. Set `self.activation_function` in `__init__` to your sigmoid function.
# 2. Implement the forward pass in the `train` method.
# 3. Implement the backpropagation algorithm in the `train` method, including calculating the output error.
# 4. Implement the forward pass in the `run` method.
#   
#

# ## Training the network
# 
# Here you'll set the hyperparameters for the network. The strategy here is to find hyperparameters such that the error on the training set is low, but you're not overfitting to the data. If you train the network too long or have too many hidden nodes, it can become overly specific to the training set and will fail to generalize to the validation set. That is, the loss on the validation set will start increasing as the training set loss drops.
# 
# You'll also be using a method know as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to train the network. The idea is that for each training pass, you grab a random sample of the data instead of using the whole data set. You use many more training passes than with normal gradient descent, but each pass is much faster. This ends up training the network more efficiently. You'll learn more about SGD later.
# 
# ### Choose the number of iterations
# This is the number of batches of samples from the training data we'll use to train the network. The more iterations you use, the better the model will fit the data. However, if you use too many iterations, then the model with not generalize well to other data, this is called overfitting. You want to find a number here where the network has a low training loss, and the validation loss is at a minimum. As you start overfitting, you'll see the training loss continue to decrease while the validation loss starts to increase.
# 
# ### Choose the learning rate
# This scales the size of weight updates. If this is too big, the weights tend to explode and the network fails to fit the data. A good choice to start at is 0.1. If the network has problems fitting the data, try reducing the learning rate. Note that the lower the learning rate, the smaller the steps are in the weight updates and the longer it takes for the neural network to converge.
# 
# ### Choose the number of hidden nodes
# The more hidden nodes you have, the more accurate predictions the model will make. Try a few different numbers and see how it affects the performance. You can look at the losses dictionary for a metric of the network performance. If the number of hidden units is too low, then the model won't have enough space to learn and if it is too high there are too many options for the direction that the learning can take. The trick here is to find the right balance in number of hidden units you choose.

# #### Your answer below

# # Anna KaRNNa
# 
# In this notebook, I'll build a character-wise RNN trained on Anna Karenina, one of my all-time favorite books. It'll be able to generate new text based on the text from the book.
# 
# This network is based off of Andrej Karpathy's [post on RNNs](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) and [implementation in Torch](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn). Also, some information [here at r2rt](http://r2rt.com/recurrent-neural-networks-in-tensorflow-ii.html) and from [Sherjil Ozair](https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow) on GitHub. Below is the general architecture of the character-wise RNN.
# 
# <img src="assets/charseq.jpeg" width="500">
# 

import time
from collections import namedtuple

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf


# First we'll load the text file and convert it into integers for our network to use. Here I'm creating a couple dictionaries to convert the characters to and from integers. Encoding the characters as integers makes it easier to use as input in the network.
# 

with open('anna.txt', 'r') as f:
    text=f.read()
vocab = sorted(set(text))
vocab_to_int = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(vocab)}
int_to_vocab = dict(enumerate(vocab))
encoded = np.array([vocab_to_int[c] for c in text], dtype=np.int32)


# Let's check out the first 100 characters, make sure everything is peachy. According to the [American Book Review](http://americanbookreview.org/100bestlines.asp), this is the 6th best first line of a book ever.
# 

text[:100]


# And we can see the characters encoded as integers.
# 

encoded[:100]


# Since the network is working with individual characters, it's similar to a classification problem in which we are trying to predict the next character from the previous text.  Here's how many 'classes' our network has to pick from.
# 

len(vocab)


# ## Making training mini-batches
# 
# Here is where we'll make our mini-batches for training. Remember that we want our batches to be multiple sequences of some desired number of sequence steps. Considering a simple example, our batches would look like this:
# 
# <img src="assets/sequence_batching@1x.png" width=500px>
# 
# 
# <br>
# We have our text encoded as integers as one long array in `encoded`. Let's create a function that will give us an iterator for our batches. I like using [generator functions](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/04/07/improve-your-python-yield-and-generators-explained/) to do this. Then we can pass `encoded` into this function and get our batch generator.
# 
# The first thing we need to do is discard some of the text so we only have completely full batches. Each batch contains $N \times M$ characters, where $N$ is the batch size (the number of sequences) and $M$ is the number of steps. Then, to get the number of batches we can make from some array `arr`, you divide the length of `arr` by the batch size. Once you know the number of batches and the batch size, you can get the total number of characters to keep.
# 
# After that, we need to split `arr` into $N$ sequences. You can do this using `arr.reshape(size)` where `size` is a tuple containing the dimensions sizes of the reshaped array. We know we want $N$ sequences (`n_seqs` below), let's make that the size of the first dimension. For the second dimension, you can use `-1` as a placeholder in the size, it'll fill up the array with the appropriate data for you. After this, you should have an array that is $N \times (M * K)$ where $K$ is the number of batches.
# 
# Now that we have this array, we can iterate through it to get our batches. The idea is each batch is a $N \times M$ window on the array. For each subsequent batch, the window moves over by `n_steps`. We also want to create both the input and target arrays. Remember that the targets are the inputs shifted over one character. You'll usually see the first input character used as the last target character, so something like this:
# ```python
# y[:, :-1], y[:, -1] = x[:, 1:], x[:, 0]
# ```
# where `x` is the input batch and `y` is the target batch.
# 
# The way I like to do this window is use `range` to take steps of size `n_steps` from $0$ to `arr.shape[1]`, the total number of steps in each sequence. That way, the integers you get from `range` always point to the start of a batch, and each window is `n_steps` wide.

# ## Building the model
# 
# Below is where you'll build the network. We'll break it up into parts so it's easier to reason about each bit. Then we can connect them up into the whole network.
# 
# <img src="assets/charRNN.png" width=500px>
# 
# 
# ### Inputs
# 
# First off we'll create our input placeholders. As usual we need placeholders for the training data and the targets. We'll also create a placeholder for dropout layers called `keep_prob`.
# 

def build_inputs(batch_size, num_steps):
    ''' Define placeholders for inputs, targets, and dropout 
    
        Arguments
        ---------
        batch_size: Batch size, number of sequences per batch
        num_steps: Number of sequence steps in a batch
        
    '''
    # Declare placeholders we'll feed into the graph
    inputs = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, [batch_size, num_steps], name='inputs')
    targets = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, [batch_size, num_steps], name='targets')
    
    # Keep probability placeholder for drop out layers
    keep_prob = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, name='keep_prob')
    
    return inputs, targets, keep_prob


# ### LSTM Cell
# 
# Here we will create the LSTM cell we'll use in the hidden layer. We'll use this cell as a building block for the RNN. So we aren't actually defining the RNN here, just the type of cell we'll use in the hidden layer.
# 
# We first create a basic LSTM cell with
# 
# ```python
# lstm = tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell(num_units)
# ```
# 
# where `num_units` is the number of units in the hidden layers in the cell. Then we can add dropout by wrapping it with 
# 
# ```python
# tf.contrib.rnn.DropoutWrapper(lstm, output_keep_prob=keep_prob)
# ```
# You pass in a cell and it will automatically add dropout to the inputs or outputs. Finally, we can stack up the LSTM cells into layers with [`tf.contrib.rnn.MultiRNNCell`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.0/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/rnn/MultiRNNCell). With this, you pass in a list of cells and it will send the output of one cell into the next cell. Previously with TensorFlow 1.0, you could do this
# 
# ```python
# tf.contrib.rnn.MultiRNNCell([cell]*num_layers)
# ```
# 
# This might look a little weird if you know Python well because this will create a list of the same `cell` object. However, TensorFlow 1.0 will create different weight matrices for all `cell` objects. But, starting with TensorFlow 1.1 you actually need to create new cell objects in the list. To get it to work in TensorFlow 1.1, it should look like
# 
# ```python
# def build_cell(num_units, keep_prob):
#     lstm = tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell(num_units)
#     drop = tf.contrib.rnn.DropoutWrapper(lstm, output_keep_prob=keep_prob)
#     
#     return drop
#     
# tf.contrib.rnn.MultiRNNCell([build_cell(num_units, keep_prob) for _ in range(num_layers)])
# ```
# 
# Even though this is actually multiple LSTM cells stacked on each other, you can treat the multiple layers as one cell.
# 
# We also need to create an initial cell state of all zeros. This can be done like so
# 
# ```python
# initial_state = cell.zero_state(batch_size, tf.float32)
# ```
# 
# Below, we implement the `build_lstm` function to create these LSTM cells and the initial state.
# 

def build_lstm(lstm_size, num_layers, batch_size, keep_prob):
    ''' Build LSTM cell.
    
        Arguments
        ---------
        keep_prob: Scalar tensor (tf.placeholder) for the dropout keep probability
        lstm_size: Size of the hidden layers in the LSTM cells

        batch_size: Batch size

    ### Build the LSTM Cell
    
    def build_cell(lstm_size, keep_prob):
        # Use a basic LSTM cell
        lstm = tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell(lstm_size)
        
        # Add dropout to the cell
        drop = tf.contrib.rnn.DropoutWrapper(lstm, output_keep_prob=keep_prob)
        return drop
    
    
    # Stack up multiple LSTM layers, for deep learning
    cell = tf.contrib.rnn.MultiRNNCell([build_cell(lstm_size, keep_prob) for _ in range(num_layers)])
    initial_state = cell.zero_state(batch_size, tf.float32)
    
    return cell, initial_state


# ### RNN Output
# 
# Here we'll create the output layer. We need to connect the output of the RNN cells to a full connected layer with a softmax output. The softmax output gives us a probability distribution we can use to predict the next character.
# 
# If our input has batch size $N$, number of steps $M$, and the hidden layer has $L$ hidden units, then the output is a 3D tensor with size $N \times M \times L$. The output of each LSTM cell has size $L$, we have $M$ of them, one for each sequence step, and we have $N$ sequences. So the total size is $N \times M \times L$.
# 
# We are using the same fully connected layer, the same weights, for each of the outputs. Then, to make things easier, we should reshape the outputs into a 2D tensor with shape $(M * N) \times L$. That is, one row for each sequence and step, where the values of each row are the output from the LSTM cells.
# 
# One we have the outputs reshaped, we can do the matrix multiplication with the weights. We need to wrap the weight and bias variables in a variable scope with `tf.variable_scope(scope_name)` because there are weights being created in the LSTM cells. TensorFlow will throw an error if the weights created here have the same names as the weights created in the LSTM cells, which they will be default. To avoid this, we wrap the variables in a variable scope so we can give them unique names.
# 

def build_output(lstm_output, in_size, out_size):
    ''' Build a softmax layer, return the softmax output and logits.
    
        Arguments

        out_size: Size of this softmax layer

# ### Training loss
# 
# Next up is the training loss. We get the logits and targets and calculate the softmax cross-entropy loss. First we need to one-hot encode the targets, we're getting them as encoded characters. Then, reshape the one-hot targets so it's a 2D tensor with size $(M*N) \times C$ where $C$ is the number of classes/characters we have. Remember that we reshaped the LSTM outputs and ran them through a fully connected layer with $C$ units. So our logits will also have size $(M*N) \times C$.
# 
# Then we run the logits and targets through `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` and find the mean to get the loss.
# 

def build_loss(logits, targets, lstm_size, num_classes):
    ''' Calculate the loss from the logits and the targets.
    
        Arguments
        ---------
        logits: Logits from final fully connected layer
        targets: Targets for supervised learning
        lstm_size: Number of LSTM hidden units

    loss = tf.reduce_mean(loss)
    return loss


# ### Optimizer
# 
# Here we build the optimizer. Normal RNNs have have issues gradients exploding and disappearing. LSTMs fix the disappearance problem, but the gradients can still grow without bound. To fix this, we can clip the gradients above some threshold. That is, if a gradient is larger than that threshold, we set it to the threshold. This will ensure the gradients never grow overly large. Then we use an AdamOptimizer for the learning step.
# 

def build_optimizer(loss, learning_rate, grad_clip):
    ''' Build optmizer for training, using gradient clipping.
    
        Arguments:
        loss: Network loss
        learning_rate: Learning rate for optimizer
    
    '''

    grads, _ = tf.clip_by_global_norm(tf.gradients(loss, tvars), grad_clip)
    train_op = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate)
    optimizer = train_op.apply_gradients(zip(grads, tvars))
    
    return optimizer


# ### Build the network
# 
# Now we can put all the pieces together and build a class for the network. To actually run data through the LSTM cells, we will use [`tf.nn.dynamic_rnn`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.0/api_docs/python/tf/nn/dynamic_rnn). This function will pass the hidden and cell states across LSTM cells appropriately for us. It returns the outputs for each LSTM cell at each step for each sequence in the mini-batch. It also gives us the final LSTM state. We want to save this state as `final_state` so we can pass it to the first LSTM cell in the the next mini-batch run. For `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn`, we pass in the cell and initial state we get from `build_lstm`, as well as our input sequences. Also, we need to one-hot encode the inputs before going into the RNN. 
#

        ### Run the data through the RNN layers
        # First, one-hot encode the input tokens
        x_one_hot = tf.one_hot(self.inputs, num_classes)
        
        # Run each sequence step through the RNN and collect the outputs

# ## Hyperparameters
# 
# Here I'm defining the hyperparameters for the network. 
# 
# * `batch_size` - Number of sequences running through the network in one pass.
# * `num_steps` - Number of characters in the sequence the network is trained on. Larger is better typically, the network will learn more long range dependencies. But it takes longer to train. 100 is typically a good number here.
# * `lstm_size` - The number of units in the hidden layers.
# * `num_layers` - Number of hidden LSTM layers to use
# * `learning_rate` - Learning rate for training
# * `keep_prob` - The dropout keep probability when training. If you're network is overfitting, try decreasing this.
# 
# Here's some good advice from Andrej Karpathy on training the network. I'm going to copy it in here for your benefit, but also link to [where it originally came from](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn#tips-and-tricks).
# 
# > ## Tips and Tricks
# 
# >### Monitoring Validation Loss vs. Training Loss
# >If you're somewhat new to Machine Learning or Neural Networks it can take a bit of expertise to get good models. The most important quantity to keep track of is the difference between your training loss (printed during training) and the validation loss (printed once in a while when the RNN is run on the validation data (by default every 1000 iterations)). In particular:
# 
# > - If your training loss is much lower than validation loss then this means the network might be **overfitting**. Solutions to this are to decrease your network size, or to increase dropout. For example you could try dropout of 0.5 and so on.
# > - If your training/validation loss are about equal then your model is **underfitting**. Increase the size of your model (either number of layers or the raw number of neurons per layer)
# 
# > ### Approximate number of parameters
# 
# > The two most important parameters that control the model are `lstm_size` and `num_layers`. I would advise that you always use `num_layers` of either 2/3. The `lstm_size` can be adjusted based on how much data you have. The two important quantities to keep track of here are:
# 
# > - The number of parameters in your model. This is printed when you start training.
# > - The size of your dataset. 1MB file is approximately 1 million characters.
# 
# >These two should be about the same order of magnitude. It's a little tricky to tell. Here are some examples:
# 
# > - I have a 100MB dataset and I'm using the default parameter settings (which currently print 150K parameters). My data size is significantly larger (100 mil >> 0.15 mil), so I expect to heavily underfit. I am thinking I can comfortably afford to make `lstm_size` larger.
# > - I have a 10MB dataset and running a 10 million parameter model. I'm slightly nervous and I'm carefully monitoring my validation loss. If it's larger than my training loss then I may want to try to increase dropout a bit and see if that helps the validation loss.
# 
# > ### Best models strategy
# 
# >The winning strategy to obtaining very good models (if you have the compute time) is to always err on making the network larger (as large as you're willing to wait for it to compute) and then try different dropout values (between 0,1). Whatever model has the best validation performance (the loss, written in the checkpoint filename, low is good) is the one you should use in the end.
# 
# >It is very common in deep learning to run many different models with many different hyperparameter settings, and in the end take whatever checkpoint gave the best validation performance.
# 
# >By the way, the size of your training and validation splits are also parameters. Make sure you have a decent amount of data in your validation set or otherwise the validation performance will be noisy and not very informative.

Then, we pass that state back into the network so the next batch can continue the state from the previous batch. And every so often (set by `save_every_n`) I save a checkpoint.

I also included some functionality to prime the network with some text by passing in a string and building up a state from that.
